# CitizenOnboard is digital activism
When [HealthCare.gov](www.healthcare.gov) didn't work, it was a big deal:

It was a crisis that demanded attention from the White house and an unprecedented intervention by a [surgical tech team](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2013/12/healthcare_gov_nov_30_deadline_the_tech_surge_is_working.html). It was a national emergency. But once it started working, our attention drifted. 

CitizenOnboard is a reminder that the emergency isn't over:
>…one privilege the insured and well-off have is to excuse the terrible quality of services the government routinely delivers to the poor. Too often, the press ignores — or simply never knows — the pain and trouble of interfacing with government bureaucracies that the poor struggle with daily. That can allow the problems in those bureaucracies to fester. — [Ezra Klein](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/10/25/obamacares-problems-go-much-deeper-than-the-web-site/)

Inspired by [UserOnboard](http://www.useronboard.com/), CitizenOnboard is a collaborative project to show how our own government services really work and don't work. Here's our first Onboarding Teardown for Food Stamps in California:
