# CitizenOnboard
[CitizenOnboard](http://citizenonboard.com) is a national project to understand how our own government services work - and don't work. We tear down so we can build up.

# Contribute
If you send us a slideshow (Keynote or PPT work), we'll do the rest:

1. **Pick a service** (if you need ideas, start with the [SNAP Census](#16)).
2. Go through the service yourself and take a bunch of **screenshots** using [Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-captur/alelhddbbhepgpmgidjdcjakblofbmce?hl=en) (or something else).
3. **Download** the [Keynote](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hjdd652uwa6vrol/AACXwjoufWC7V3OtK6nBivUwa?dl=1) or [PowerPoint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/clhfnurfjnmu0sp/template.pptx?dl=1) templates.
4. **Express** yourself! Go ahead and make the presentation your own. Be thorough and be yourself. Check out other teardowns from [UserOnboard.com](http://useronboard.com) or [CitizenOnboard.com](http://citizenonboard.com) for inspiration.
5. **Send us** the slideshow: [www.dropitto.me/citizenonboard](http://dropitto.me/CitizenOnboard) (password = *onboard*).

We'll handle the rest and ping you know when it's up!
