# Citizen Onboard
Citizen onboard is a collaborative project to document and describe how our own government services work (and don't work). Inspired by the endlessly awesome [@UserOnboard](http://www.twitter.com/useronboard). Here's what we have so far:
- [CalFresh](calfresh)
- [CoveredCA](coveredca) (draft)
- ...more coming soon!
